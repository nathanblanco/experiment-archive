                    <b>Confidentiality of Data:</b>
				Any work performed on MTurk can be linked to the user’s Amazon.com public profile page. 
				Thus, workers may wish to restrict what information they choose to share in their public 
				profile. MTurk worker IDs (i.e., the 14 character sequence of letters and numbers used 
				to identify workers) will be collected for the purpose of providing compensation, but 
				MTurk worker IDs will NOT be shared with anyone. MTurk worker IDs will be removed from 
				the data set. More information regarding Amazon’s Mechanical Turk privacy policies can 
				be found here: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice. If it becomes necessary for 
				the Institutional Review Board to review the study records, information that can be 
				linked to you will be protected to the extent permitted by law. Your research records 
				will not be released without your consent unless required by law or a court order. 
				The data resulting from your participation may be made available to other researchers 
				in the future for research purposes not detailed within this consent form. In these cases, 
				the data will contain no identifying information that could associate it with you, or with 
				your participation in any study.

				Your participation is voluntary. You can decide not to be in the study at all. 
				If you start the study, you can stop at any time by just closing your browser window. 
				Stopping or not being in the study won’t affect your relationship with The University 
				of Texas at Austin in any way. However, you will not receive payment unless you complete 
				the study in its entirety.
