	    	In this experiment, we are interested in how people deal with making choices in changing environments. 
	    	On each turn you will choose a card from one of four decks of cards. Once a deck is chosen you will be
	    	shown how many points the card was worth. You will start with 15,000 points, and each choice will cause 
	    	you to LOSE points. Each deck is different, and which deck is best may change over time.
        </p>

        <p>
        	You goal is to try to lose as few points as possible 
	    	and finish the game with the highest total score. There will be 250 total turns.
        </p>
        
        <p>
		You will receive a bonus between $0 and $1 based on your score. Click below to begin when you are ready.
