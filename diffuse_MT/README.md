Diffusion MTurk Experiment:

This is code that runs a simple decision-making task on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. It 
includes several pre-questionnaires to test the effects of symptoms of depression and
ADHD on aspects of exploratory decision-making. The experiment is built and run using
psiturk (https://psiturk.org/; https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk). The main task code
is in the /static/js/task.js file and the various html files in the /templates folder. 
This code was written and used to collect data sometime around 2014 or 2015.
