Two-stage task code:

This code runs a version of the two-stage task that has been used extensively 
to investigate model-free vs. model-based decision-making. It utilizes the 
PyPsyExp (http://gureckislab.org/pypsyexp/sphinx/; https://github.com/NYUCCL/PyPsyExp) 
framework which is included in the /lib folder. Running the experiment requires Python 2.x, 
Numpy, and Pygame. To start the experiment run the exp_stages.py file. 
This code was written and used to collect data in 2012/2013.
