Patterns experiment:

This code runs an experiment that tests how children learn and reason about different 
kinds of patterns. It utilizes the PyPsyExp (http://gureckislab.org/pypsyexp/sphinx/; 
https://github.com/NYUCCL/PyPsyExp) framework which is included in the /lib folder. 
Running the experiment requires Python 2.x, Numpy, and Pygame. To start the experiment 
run the patterns.py file. This code was written around 2018.
